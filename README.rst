Server development
------------------

You will need:

* Python 3.9 or later (``brew install python@3.9``)
* PostgreSQL (``brew install postgres`` or Postgres.app_)
* yarn (``brew install yarn``)
* virtualenv

.. _Postgres.app: https://postgresapp.com/

Ensure the development database exists::

   createdb wheretofindme

Set the following environment variables in a ``.env`` file in the repo
root::

   export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=$(uuidgen)
   export DJANGO_DEBUG=True
   export SENDGRID_API_KEY=INVALID

Set up your virtualenv with your preferred method. For me, using
``virtualenvwrapper`` and ``pyenv``, this looks like::

   $ mkvirtualenv wheretofindme --python=$(pyenv which python3.9)
   $ setvirtualenvproject
   $ pip install pip-tools
   $ pip-sync requirements/dev.txt requirements/base.txt

You'll have to read the contents of your ``.env`` file into your local
shell's environment. You may want to set up a system to do this each
time you activate this virtualenv. For one way to do this, see
:ref:`env-vars` below.

Then get the database into a good state::

   $ python manage.py migrate

Then get the frontend building::

   $ yarn install
   $ yarn serve

Then, you can visit the local site at ``http://localhost:8000/``. The
terminal output will say ``:8080``, but ignore it, it's a liar.

Dependencies
------------

To add Python dependencies, add them to ``requirements/{dev,base}.in``,
then recompile the locks::

   $ pip-compile requirements/base.in && pip-compile requirements/dev.in

To add JavaScript dependencies::

   $ yarn add (--dev) <dep name>

Tests
-----

The Python tests are written using ``pytest``, ``pytest-django``,
``pytest-cov``, and ``pytest-factoryboy``. You can run them easily with
``yarn py:test:unit``.

The JavaScript tests are written using Jest and Vue's unit-test helpers.
You can run them easily with ``yarn js:test:unit``.

We require 100% test coverage on both parts. We will gladly help you
with any test-writing issues you may have.

.. _env-vars:

Setting environment variables automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use ``virtualenvwrapper``, one way to automatically set your
environment variables when you activate your virtualenv is to use the
``postactivate`` hook. Having activated your virtualenv, edit
``$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate`` to contain the following code::

   if [[ -e .env ]]; then
       # Strip comment lines out of the .env file, and read
       # the rest in to the environment.
       export $(grep -v "^[ \t]*#" .env)
   fi

This will read your ``.env`` file into your shell's environment each
time you activate the virtualenv. It does no cleanup on deactivation; I
must admit I've never found that important enough to be worth the
trouble of implementing!
