<h1 class="text-center">Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="text-justify">
  We wanna keep things simple.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
  We won't sell your information, but all the links you put up on your profile
  are publicly available. We may email you from time to time, if there's
  important information like a data breach or a significant change to the
  service or these terms of service. We promise we'll do so as rarely as
  possible.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
  You assert that the links on your profile point to identities that you have
  some control over. Don't just claim you're someone else, that'd be weird and
  pointless. If you do point to identities that aren't yours, we reserve the
  right to restrict or bar you from the service.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
  We use cookies to enable you to log in to the site. We don't have any
  tracking cookies or anything like that. But if you want to log in, you have
  to accept that we have to use cookies to do that.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
  Please be kind.
</p>
<h2 class="text-center" id="abuse-and-deletion">Abuse and Deletion</h2>
<p class="text-justify">
  If you find that someone has claimed they own an identity that's actually
  yours, please
  <a
    href="mailto:admin@wheretofind.me?subject=Where%20to%20Find%20Me%20removal%20request"
    >contact us</a> and we will try to resolve the
  issue.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
  We will ask you to demonstrate to our satisfaction that you actually control
  the identity in question, and once you do, we will take down the identity,
  and send a warning to the user who posted it. We will typically ask you to
  confirm ownership by asking you to post a short innocuous random phrase to
  that identity, but may change this to some other technique if the particular
  service constrains your ability to do so.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
  If a user repeatedly abuses this policy, either by posting identities they
  don't control, or by claiming ownership spuriously, we reserve the right to
  restrict or block their access to Where to Find Me.
